\chapter{Design}
 - Main design goals:   
    >> Fast loading times
    >> Nice-looking scenes
    >> Scenes which might resemble a game
    >> Ability to assess performance relative to a non-procedural version
    >> Easy to edit design program
 - How were design goals addressed?
    >> Seperate of procedural and non-procedural versions.
    >> Pipeline for generation of content.
    >> Created texture generators from scratch
    >> Perlin Nose done in frag shader (V.low latency)
    >> Design program written in processing which makes the results quick to see and is also easy to edit

 - What the influences were ?
    >> Architecture
        -> Christopher Alexander's "A Pattern Language"
        -> Plan generation relies on this heavily
    >> CityEngine
    >> Quake
        -> GL Quake
        -> Quake under gwt
